	<p>I'm Sawyer, and I am Imperial Designs</p>

	<p>I was born and raised in Spokane Washington. Even though I'm a designer now, it's not something that I've always been. I went to high school at Joel E. Ferris, which was only 6 blocks from my house. In my Junior year of high school I started the Running Start program at SCC and SFCC. After graduating high school with some college courses completed, I went to Northwest University in Kirkland, WA to study music. After the first year I reconsidered my degree and decided to go to Eastern Washington University to study engineering. Soon afterward I discovered that engineering was not my strong suit either, so I talked to some of the professors and decided to start my journey in the Visual Communication Design program. Which puts me here! Writing a webpage that I'll be able to use as a form of resum√©.</p>
